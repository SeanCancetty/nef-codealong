## Set up Project:

Run the following in the terminal:

* ```pip install flask```
* ```pip install flask_session```

## Git workflow (trunk-based development):

* ```git checkout main```

* ```git pull```

* ```git checkout -b ticket-no-team-name```

* Some dev work.

* ```git add .```

* ```git commit -m "Enter short and clear message of what the commit does"```

* ```git push```

* Try to commit and push often (the above three commands)

* When finished with the ticket, create a Pull Request. Review it with team. If happy, merge into mainline.

* Rinse and repeat for a new ticket

(There are other git commands available for more specific scenarios - use resources as and when needed)
